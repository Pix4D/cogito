- Extensive documentation.

## [v0.2.1] - 2019-10-22

### Fixed

- If the git resource has a tag_filter, cogito parsing of the commit SHA is broken.

- The context of Cogito notifications make it impossible to use GitHub branch protection rules.

- Split contributing and developing information from README into their own DEVELOPMENT (then CONTRIBUTING) file.
- Simplify testdata

### Added
